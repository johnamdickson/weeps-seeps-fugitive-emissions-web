## UX
### Strategy
The primary objective of this .

#### Project Goals

The following goals were identified for the project:
- .


#### Agile Methodology

The project followed an Agile Project Management approach, completing ** epics consisting of various user stories. These stories were categorized using MoSCoW prioritization, labeled in GitHub as *Must Have*, *Should Have*, *Could Have*, and *Won't Have*. Each user story was assigned a timebox value using the Fibonacci Sequence. Throughout the project, sprints were conducted, selecting user stories with a timebox value of no more than  per sprint. Epics, user stories, and bugs were tracked and visualized using GitHub's Project Kanban board feature, accessible [here.]()


#### User Stories

As stated, the user stories were collated into ** epics.
<br>![user-story-breakdown]()<br><br>
The total number of story points assigned to the user stories is ** of which the majority were in the category of  storypoints. 
<br>![user-story-breakdown]()<br>

Each of the user stories were broken down into tasks and acceptance criteria which can be reviewed on the project [kanban board]().

### Scope
#### Essential Content
  - 

#### Optional Content
  -

### Structure
#### Data Storage
- .<br><br>
![database schema]()
- The front end utilises bootstrap and bespoke styling for a user friendly, designed approach. 
#### Search Engine Optimisation
- A SEO study was completed and can be found [here.]()
- A selection of short and long tail keywords were selected for use with the html head and body elements.
- A sitemap.xml file was created using an online tool and added to the project root directory.
- A robots.txt file was created and added to the project root directory.
### Skeleton
#### Wireframes
- The desktop wireframes can be found [here.]()
- The mobile and tablet wireframes can be found [here.]()
### Surface (Design)
#### Colour Scheme

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used
- **Javascript**: Used for front end functionality notably the Google Maps API, conditional formatting.
- **HTML5**: Used for rendering the DOM.
- **CSS3**: Used to apply custom styling where bootstrap did not extend to the project design requirements.
- **Markdown**: Used exclusively for README and TESTING.<br>

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for class based styling directly in the DOM.

- **json**: used to create json of instantiated model date for use in Javascript.
- **Gitpod** cloud based IDE used for majority of the project.
- **Git** used for version control.
- **GitHub** as cloud repository for Git version control.
- Any other libraries not explicitly mentioned here can be found in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

## Deployment


### Integrated Development Environment 


### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/johnamdickson/portfolio-project-3)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/johnamdickson/portfolio-project-3)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```
