## UX

### Strategy

#### Project Goals
- Create a secure, intuitive web platform for documenting and monitoring weeps, seeps, and fugitive emissions.
- Support authenticated users with personalized profiles and role-based access (Admin, Superuser, User).
- Automatically log out users after inactivity while warning them in advance.

#### Marketing Strategy
- Internal utility tool aimed at site inspectors, engineers, and emissions monitors.
- Branding reflects professionalism, simplicity, and safety.

#### Agile Methodology
The project followed Agile practices using GitHub Issues and Projects to manage epics and user stories with MoSCoW prioritization.

#### User Stories
Each user story was assigned timebox values using Fibonacci points and managed via a Kanban board. Example epics include:
- Auth and Session Management
- Profile and Avatar Handling
- Admin Features
- Toast Messaging System

---

### Scope

#### Essential Content
- Login/logout via Firebase Auth
- User profile modal with image upload
- Auto-logout with countdown toast
- Admin dashboard access control

#### Optional Content
- Search bar (currently front-end only)
- Debug page for internal testing
- UI enhancements via Bootstrap tooltips and modals

---

### Structure

#### Data Storage
- Firebase Auth stores user credentials.
- Firestore holds role claims.
- Firebase Storage manages avatar images.

#### Search Engine Optimisation
- A sitemap.xml and robots.txt exist in root.
- Basic metadata and semantic HTML used.
